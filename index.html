        <h2>Is just an overall bad idea</h2>

    <div class="d2">
            <h2>Tennis...</h2>
            <p>Is a waste of time when you could playing badminton or watching tv. Tennis is a boring sport, unless you enjoy it</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="d1">
        <h2>Tennis...</h2>
        <p>Is hard because the tennis ball is too hard to hit, which hurts your wrist</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="d2">
        <h2>Tennis...</h2>
        <p>Is bad because there are many injuries you can get that will then effect your badminton game and training</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="d1">
        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p>Is really confusing and doesn't make any sense, especially the scoring, but everything about tennis doesn't make sense</p>

        <h2>Tennis...</h2>
        <p>...Whyyyy when you can play a great sport like badminton... Why play tennis</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="d1">
        <h2>Tennis...</h2>
        <p>Is played outside, which is bad because of the unpredictable weather. It might start hailing very hard and hurt everyone badly who is playing tennis, but at badminton everyone would be fine</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="d2">
        <h2>Tennis...</h2>
        <p>Is not an option because I already have a commitment on Tuesdays. It would be bad to quit my commitments. Plus it would be a bad role model for Dylan</p>
    </div>

    <div class="d1">
        <h2>Tennis...</h2>

        <h2>Tennis...</h2>
        <p>Quote: It will be quite tough for badminton players to play tennis for the first time since everything is pretty much different</p>

        <h2>Tennis...</h2>

    <hr>
    <div class="d2">
        <h2>WHYYYY!</h2>
        <p>Why play tennis when you can play badminton. Badminton is an amazing sport that is fun, unlike tennis. Tennis is a waste of time and isn't productive</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="d1">
        <h2>In conclusion </h2>
        <p>Why play a sport like tennis when you can play badminton. Badminton is such a great sport and tennis is boring and pointless. It is very confusing and I dont know how to play, so joining a club where everyone already knows how to is a bad idea. It also makes me a bad role model for quiting Tuesday badminton</p>
